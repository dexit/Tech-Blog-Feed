Under a GPL License (or just GPL), a particular user can freely use, modify, or redistribute software without any restrictions. A popular example of software that uses GPL is WordPress, meaning anyone can use, modify, or extend the source code as desired. In the context of the WordPress project, GPL is equal to the software’s bill of rights.

- It grants open-source permissions for users including:

- The right to download and run the software freely

- The right to make changes to the software as desired

- The right to redistribute copies of the software

- The right to modify and distribute copies of new versions of the software

GPL achieves its goals by using the concept of copyleft. An obvious spin on copyright, copyleft uses copyright laws to enforce the open-source status of software. By copyrighting freedom into a software license, developers can ensure none of their software becomes proprietary when it’s modified or extended by another user.
